# Clima
Clima is a flutter weather app where in you type the name of the city and then get the weather condition of that place.
The main motive of this project was to learn how to integrate flutter app with api and learn about asynchronous programming in Dart. 
I primarily focused on how to use api's in an app and also tried to improve my UI/UX skills.
